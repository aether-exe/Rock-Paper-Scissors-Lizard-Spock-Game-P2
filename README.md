This will be a functioning Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game made on GitPod using HTML, CSS & Javascript.

My plan is to sketch the boilerplate code and keep the structure simple so I can work with a clean style. Then I can focus on ensuring I write sensible 
code that is fully validated.

I will upload the staged code - but due to personal issues I've been unable to put close to any time on this yet, this current version and initial
commits are a skeleton I've prepared to submit for my late submission deadline (02/02/22) - But once I've got my time and mental health back on track
I will resume & flesh out this README properly.
